A streamlined database and search/organizational tool
to avoid scrolling through so many games you don't 
care to see or know about, or never even play.
Add and subtract games from main database and placed
into more specified sub branches(you make and name) so
they only show if you choose to search for them. It will 
include games from any store or sites on the web and or 
offering apk/xapk, mods, incomparable or discontinued games
or even forein.
